# Path-Integration
This project explores how animals implement path integration and how fine tuned the integrating system must be to work efficiently.

Path integration is the process of how an animal calculate the updated position of the animal by monitoring its trajectory in relation to a start location. In essence, animals add up vectors over long periods of travel to remember how to get home. A popular example is the desert ant.
